This folder consists of the functionality to verify a proxy knowledge base during the process of deserialization from a proxy knowledge-base to a real knowledge-base. The multiple classes here are used to convey information regarding any encountered errors such that errors can be effectively caught and presented to the user in a meaningful manner. In effect, this is analogous to the error-catching facility of the IDE program, used while writing code. The code in this case is the XML written by the knowledge-engineer to define the elements of a knowledge-base (eg. rules, facts, observations, preamble).
