=====================

This page contains background information of what an Expert-System is, and then goes into some detail regarding the individual components of the system and algorithmic properties.

Note that this is part of an explanation I created on Expert-Systems while me and my mentor were in the process of brainstorming how our Expert-System would work. The basic method of operation has not changed (this is an updated document to reflect any changes that were made during the implementation stage).

Also note that the implementation is not complete--there is still much work left before we have a fully functioning Expert-System!
